* Network: Exchange information between networked computers --> And this information is transferred via packets.
* **What are Packets**
  * Streams of bits running as electric signals on physical media used for data transmission
  * These electric signals --> Interpreted as bits (zeros and ones)
  * **Structure of a Packet**
    * HEADER (Protocol related info.) + PAYLOAD (Actual data)
   
# OSI model
1. Physical LAyer ---> USB, Ethernet cable, Coax, Fiber, Hubs
2. Data Link layer --> Ethernet, PPP, Switches
3. Network layer --> IP, ICMP, IPSec
4. Transport layer --> TCP, UDP
5. Session layer --> APIs, NetBIOS, RPC
6. Presentation layer --> SSL/TLS, JPEG, GIF, SSH, IMAP
7. Application layer --> HTTP, FTP, IRC, SSH, DNS

## Network layer
* Responsible for logical addressing, routing and forwarding data packets between devices across different networks.
* Finds the optimal path for data to travel from the source to the destination
* Which protocol operates at the Network layer and is commonly used for logical addressing and routing on the Internet? --> IP
* What is the purpose of the TTL (Time-to-Live) field in the IP header at the Network layer? -->  To limit the number of hops a packet can take through the network.
