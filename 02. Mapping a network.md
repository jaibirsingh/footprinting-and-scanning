# Mapping a network

## The objectives of network mapping can be enlisted as:
1.	Discovery of live hosts  Which IPs are in use.
2.	Identification of open ports and services  Figure out potential vulnerabilities.
3.	Network topology mapping    Routers, switches, firewalls and any other network infrastructural elements.
4.	OS detection
5.	Service version detection
6.	Identify security and filtering measures  Firewalls, Intrusion Prevention Systems, etc.

## Footprinting
* what is the primary focus of footprinitng in the reconnaissance phase?
  * Collecting detailed information about the target's network and systems.

## Process
1. Physical access
2. Sniffing
3. ARP
4. ICMP

### Physical Access
1. Physical Security --> Get direct physical access to the devices.
2. OSINT --> Intelligence gathering, find IP address without physically touch the network or devices
3. Social Engineering --> Get someone to know the thiings you want to know.

### Sniffing
1. Passive reconnaissaince --> TCP dump or Wireshark tools, etc. emails, websites, publically available data
2. Watch network traffic --> IP address, etc. for further enumeration.

### ARP ( Address Resolution Protocol - RFC 826)
* Maps IP address to MAC address.
* Who has 10.10.1.5? Tell 10.10.1.7 ARP's reply --> 10.10.1.5 is at 00:0c:29:af:ea:d2
* ARP can be turned off . Everything can be manullay done but it is hard.
* ARP table

### ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol - RFC 792)
* This protocol is used for diagonising network connectivity issues.
* Tools to be used with ICMP:
A). Traceroute --> It will show us all the points in between source and the destination while packets are transferred. What is source and where packets might be dropping off.
B). Ping --> It asks for a reply.

*** 

## Tools
1. Wireshark --> captures network traffic and can be used to identify endpoints from that traffic.
2. ARP-Scan
3. Ping
4. FPing
5. Nmap
6. Zenmap

* ARP-scan can be done in Wireshark
  ` sudo arp-scan -I tap0 -g 10.142.111.0/24 ` --> running it on interface tap0 of our VPN. -g is for subnet address.
* How to check subnet: ` ip a `
  
` ping [IP] ` --> IP discovered from arp-scan earlier.

* FPing: send out pings to multiple hosts at one time
  ` fping -I [interface name] -g [subdomain IP] -a `

* -a option for all the IPs active on the network

* ZENMAP: GUI version of nmap. Open source available on github.
