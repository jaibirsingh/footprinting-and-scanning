# Port Scanning

* After mapping a network, we need to identify the OS and any services running on those machines. --> To know whether we are looking at firewalls, servers or desktops

## Host Discovery techniques
1. Ping sweeps (ICMP echo requests)
2. ARP scanning
3. TCP SYN ping (Half-open scan)
4. UDP ping
5. TCP ACK ping
6. SYN-ACK ping

## How to scan for services?
* Try to connect to ports and check for the response

### Connect to TCP
* This is done by **three-way handshake** : SYN is sent --> If we receive SYN+ACK back that means port is open, thus we send ACK back and close the connection by sending RST+ACK.
* Although if we receive RST+ACK back after sending SYN, then we come to know that the port is closed.
* Another way to connect to TCP: **Stealthy scan** --> Three-way handshake was caught by firewalls, IDSs and IPSs, so this is a quieter version
* In Stelathy scan, we first send SYN, but after receiving SYN+ACK back, we don't send ACK back and then close the connection by sending RST+ACK, rather we drop the connection just by sending RST.
* Another way - Service Version: This includes three-way handshake to begin with but just before sending RST+ACK at the last, we grab a banner. This is louder than other ways.


### Connect to UDP
* These connections are slower
* Usually the response is that the port is open filtered which means that the connection was not dropped but it's filtered. (???)
* These connections can be sped by applying certain flags in nmap.

**nmap**
1. -sn: Ping scan--> disable port scan (Usually used for host discovery)
2. -sS: TCP SYN scan.
3. -sC: Run default scripts.
4. -O: enable OS detection.
5. -iL: Give a file as an argument with list of ips to run nmap on

* Note: Press space during nmap execution and it will give more details. Same can be done by increasing the verbosity by pressing v during the execution.

  ` sudo nmap -iL [file_name].][extension] -sV -sC -O -v `

**Tools**
1. Zenmap - GUI nmap
2. nmap automator
3. Masscan = Very fast port scanner uses multi-threading
4. Rustscan = Uses Rust which is a low-level language to make the scan efficient
5. Autorecon
