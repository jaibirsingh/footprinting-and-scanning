# Zenmap
* We have to put range of the IP in Zenmap GUI.

## how to check IP range of your device?
To check the IP range of your device, you can use several methods depending on your operating system and network configuration. Here are the general steps for various platforms:

### 1. Windows:

  a. Open the Command Prompt by pressing Win + R, typing "cmd," and pressing Enter.

  b. In the Command Prompt, type the following command and press Enter:
  ipconfig

  c. Look for your network adapter (usually labeled as Ethernet or Wi-Fi), and under that adapter, find the "IPv4 Address" and "Subnet Mask." The IP range for your device will be based on the IP address and subnet mask. You can calculate the range using bitwise AND operation.

### 2. macOS:

  a. Open the Terminal application from the Applications folder or by using Spotlight Search.

  b. In the Terminal, type the following command and press Enter:
  ifconfig

  c. Look for your network interface (usually labeled as en0 for Ethernet or en1 for Wi-Fi) and find the "inet" address and "netmask." The IP range can be calculated using the same bitwise AND operation as with Windows.

###  3. Linux:

  a. Open a terminal window.

  b. Type the following command and press Enter:
  ifconfig

  c. Locate your network interface (typically eth0 for Ethernet or wlan0 for Wi-Fi) and find the "inet" address and "netmask." Use bitwise AND to calculate the IP range.

### Calculating IP Range:

To calculate the IP range, you'll need to perform a bitwise AND operation between the IP address and the subnet mask. Here's a simple example:

Suppose your IP address is 192.168.1.100 and your subnet mask is 255.255.255.0.

IP Address: 192.168.1.100
Subnet Mask: 255.255.255.0
Perform a bitwise AND operation between the IP address and the subnet mask:

IP Address:   11000000.10101000.00000001.01100100
Subnet Mask:  11111111.11111111.11111111.00000000
Result:       11000000.10101000.00000001.00000000
So, your IP range would be from 192.168.1.0 to 192.168.1.255.

Keep in mind that your network configuration may vary, and the above steps are for typical home or small office networks. In more complex network setups, such as those in corporate environments, IP ranges and subnets can be more intricate, and you might need network administrator access to obtain this information.

### A ping scan on 10.4.16.0/20 is performed, what is /20 here?

* The IPv4 address `10.4.16.0/20` means that the first 20 bits of the IP address are used to represent the network, and the remaining bits are used for host addresses within that network.

In binary form:
```
IPv4 Address:   00001010.00000100.0001****.********
Subnet Mask:    11111111.11111111.1111****.********
```

* The asterisks (*) represent the bits that can vary for host addresses. In this case, there are 12 bits available for host addresses because the first 20 bits are reserved for the network.

* To find the range of host addresses within the `10.4.16.0/20` subnet, we can calculate the minimum and maximum host addresses:

- Minimum host address: `00001010.00000100.00010000.00000001` (in binary) or `10.4.16.1` (in decimal).
- Maximum host address: `00001010.00000100.00011111.11111110` (in binary) or `10.4.31.254` (in decimal).

So, if you perform a ping scan on the `10.4.16.0/20` subnet, you would be scanning host addresses from `10.4.16.1` to `10.4.31.254`, as these are the valid host addresses within that subnet.

### How to calculate the minimum and maximum host address?

To find the minimum and maximum host addresses within the 10.4.16.0/20 subnet, you should follow these steps:

1. Convert the network address 10.4.16.0 and the subnet mask 255.255.240.0 (which corresponds to /20 in CIDR notation) into binary form:

Network Address: 00001010.00000100.0001****.****
Subnet Mask: 11111111.11111111.1111****.****

2. To calculate the minimum host address, you simply set all host bits to 0 except for the last one, which is set to 1:

Minimum Host Address: 00001010.00000100.00010000.00000001 (in binary) or 10.4.16.1 (in decimal).

3. To calculate the maximum host address, you set all host bits to 1 except for the last one, which is set to 0:

Maximum Host Address: 00001010.00000100.00011111.11111110 (in binary) or 10.4.31.254 (in decimal).

So, within the 10.4.16.0/20 subnet, the minimum host address is 10.4.16.1, and the maximum host address is 10.4.31.254. These are the valid host addresses within the specified subnet range.
